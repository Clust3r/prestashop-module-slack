        // indicate that the user or channel being addressed either do not exist or are invalid. The request should not be retried without modification or until the indicated user or channel is set up.

        // indicates the specified channel has been archived and is no longer accepting new messages.

        // action_prohibited :
        // usually means that a team admin has placed some kind of restriction on this avenue of posting messages and that, at least for now, the request should not be attempted again.
